# OhMyGrid
**We empower individuals, communities and nations around the world to map the global electrical grid.** <br>

## Why?

Energy from fossil fuels are by far the largest contributor to climate change, accounting for over 75 % of global greenhouse gas emissions. Mitigating away from fossil energy sources requires the rapid extension and modernization of the electrical grid, which is currently one of the main bottlenecks to decarbonising our energy. <br></br>

Despite the urgent need to expand the global electricity grid, the industry has been unable to establish an open data standard for the exchange of transmission grid routing data and specifications across borders. In recent years, OpenStreetMap has established itself as the unofficial de facto standard in academia and industry for cross-border transmission and distribution grid data. For developing countries in particular, the quality and coverage of grid data is inadequate. Closing this gap is not only essential for providing stable energy supply to rural communities, it is also key to mitigating climate change, a key recommendation of the International Energy Agency's latest report:

> _Improve data reliability and availability to better assess and manage risks for clean energy projects in emerging market and developing economies._

That's why [Open Energy Transition](https://openenergytransition.org/) has launched this open initiative, working with the OpenStreetMap community, organisations and individuals around the world to not only create an [open digital twin of the European grid](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04550-7), but also **to expand the global coverage of the transmission grid in OpenStreetMap from around 70% to 98% over the next three years.**

## How you can get involved?
Your support can make a significant impact on closing the data gap in the electricity grid. The Oh-my-Grid initiative will empower you! Are you good at online research? Do you like programming? Do you want to recognise power towers and other electrical infrastructure on satellite images? Do you want to use this data for a climate mitigation or the electrification of rural communities? We can help you find the right contribution for your skills and experience:

When you make an edit, please use the **#ohmygrid** in the changeset to help the initiative!
