**A directory and guide to power grid infrastructure mapping in OpenStreetMap.**  

Our inititative aims to contribute to mapping countries' electricity grid systems around the world in OpenStreetMap(OSM).
This directory includes information on the initiative, a starter-kit so that you can get started with grid-mapping, a list of tools developed to map more efficiently and accurately, and the awesome list full of useful datasets!

## Why map the electricity grid and improve available data?
The energy transition requires transparent, reliable data to inform decisions on grid infrastructure, energy demand forecasting, and system optimization. 
However, current data sources like OpenStreetMap (OSM) that is used for energy planning lack the detailed specifications needed for accurate energy modelling.
Therefore, we want to improve the quality and specifications of OSM power grid data.
